            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Harshvardhan, a passionate web developer with a strong background in creating dynamic and
                responsive web applications. I have a deep understanding of both frontend and backend technologies, and
                I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to learn and grow.</p>
            <p>With a keen eye for design and a commitment to writing clean, efficient code, I strive to build websites
                that are not only functional but also visually appealing. My expertise includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                React, Java, and C++.</p>
            <p>In addition to my technical skills, I am a strong communicator and a team player. I believe in the power
                of collaboration and enjoy working with others to bring ideas to life. When I'm not coding, you can find
                me exploring new technologies, reading tech blogs, or working on personal projects.</p>
            <p>Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or learn more about my work. I'm always open to new
                opportunities and collaborations!</p>
